# React Webpack Starter Project
A simple boilerplate to kickstart your React project with Webpack as the module bundler. This setup includes all the essential configurations to help you quickly get started with a modern React application.

## Features
* React 18: A fast and efficient library for building user interfaces.
* Webpack 5: For bundling assets and modules.
* SCSS Support: Write styles in SCSS and leverage modular CSS.
* Babel: Transpile modern JavaScript for browser compatibility.
* Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Instant feedback during development.
* ESLint: Linting for consistent and error-free code.
* Production Optimization: Includes optimizations like minification and tree-shaking for deployment.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-webpack-starter.git
   ```
   ```
   cd react-webpack-starter
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the Development Server
   Run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

4. Build for Production
   To create an optimized build for production, run:

```
npm run build
```
The output will be generated in the dist/ folder.

## Available Scripts
npm start: Start the development server with live reloading.
npm run build: Build the application for production.
npm run lint: Lint the project for code quality.
npm run lint:fix: Fix linting issues automatically.

## Configuration
#### Webpack
The Webpack configuration is located in webpack.config.js. Key configurations include:

Entry and Output: Specifies the entry point (src/index.js) and output directory (dist/).
Loaders: Configures Babel for JavaScript and SCSS for styles.
Plugins: Includes HtmlWebpackPlugin to inject scripts into the HTML.
### Babel
The .babelrc file contains presets for transpiling React and modern JavaScript.

### ESLint
The .eslintrc.js file defines linting rules. Customize it based on your coding style.
